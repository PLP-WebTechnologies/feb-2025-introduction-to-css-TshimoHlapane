        <h2 class="sub-title">About Us</h2>
        <p>Our giraffe sanctuary is dedicated to the conservation and protection of giraffes in their natural habitat. We aim to raise awareness about these majestic creatures and their importance to the ecosystem.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Why Protect Giraffes?</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are a vital part of the savanna ecosystem. They help maintain the balance of vegetation and provide food for other species. Unfortunately, giraffe populations are declining due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
        <p>By supporting our sanctuary, you contribute to the preservation of giraffes and their environment for future generations.</p>
